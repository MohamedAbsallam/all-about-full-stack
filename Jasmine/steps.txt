Configuring Jasmine

Install Jasmine:
npm i jasmine

Add a reporter for outputting Jasmine results to the terminal:
npm i jasmine-spec-reporter

Add type definitions for Jasmine with :
npm i --save-dev @types/jasmine

Add Testing Scripts:
Find the scripts object in the package.json and add the following to run jasmine:
"jasmine": "jasmine"

Set Up the File Structure:
In the root directory of the project, create a folder named spec.
In the spec folder, create a folder named support.
In the support folder, create a file named jasmine.json to hold the primary configurations for Jasmine.
In the src folder, add a folder named tests.
In tests add a file named indexSpec.ts to hold the tests for code in the index.js file.
In the tests folder, add another folder named helpers.
In helpers, add a file named reporter.ts. This will be the primary configuration for your spec reporter.
